In software engineering, dependencies refer to the relationships between different software components, libraries, or modules that a project relies on to function correctly. Managing these dependencies is crucial for ensuring that the software can be built, tested, and deployed without issues.

Common types of dependencies include:
1. **Library Dependencies**: External libraries or frameworks that provide specific functionalities, such as data processing, networking, or user interface components.
2. **Module Dependencies**: Internal modules within a project that depend on each other to perform tasks.
3. **Runtime Dependencies**: Software or services that need to be present in the environment where the application runs, such as databases or web servers.
4. **Build Dependencies**: Tools and libraries required during the build process, such as compilers or build automation tools.
