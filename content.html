<p>In software engineering, dependencies refer to the relationships between different software components, libraries, or modules that a project relies on to function correctly. Managing these dependencies is crucial for ensuring that the software can be built, tested, and deployed without issues.</p>

<p>Common types of dependencies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Library Dependencies</strong>: External libraries or frameworks that provide specific functionalities, such as data processing, networking, or user interface components.</li>
<li><strong>Module Dependencies</strong>: Internal modules within a project that depend on each other to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Dependencies</strong>: Software or services that need to be present in the environment where the application runs, such as databases or web servers.</li>
<li><strong>Build Dependencies</strong>: Tools and libraries required during the build process, such as compilers or build automation tools.</li>
</ul    >
